### k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
1 algorithm is a popular machine learning algorithm used
for classification and regression tasks. The basic idea behind kNN is to identify the k
nearest data points to a given test sample and make predictions based on the
majority class of the nearest neighbors. Implementing the algorithm on CPU can be
time-consuming and limiting in terms of processing power, especially when dealing
with large datasets. In this report, I will present the implementation of kNN
algorithm using CUDA. The main objective of this project was to evaluate the
performance and efficiency of the kNN algorithm using CUDA compared to its
traditional CPU implementation. The report will describe the implementation
details, results and comparison of the two implementations.
